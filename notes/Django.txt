    app_label

        Options.app_label
            - If a model is defined outside of an application in INSTALLED_APPS, it must declare which app it belongs to:
                
                app_label = 'myapp'

    db_table

        Options.db_table
            - The name of the database table to use for the model:

        Options.get_latest_by
            - The name of a field or a list of field names in the model, typically DateField, DateTimeField, or IntegerField. This specifies the default field(s) to use in your model Manager’s latest() and earliest() methods.

                # Latest by ascending order_date.
                get_latest_by = "order_date"

                # Latest by priority descending, order_date ascending.
                get_latest_by = ['-priority', 'order_date']
